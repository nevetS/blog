Emacs at it's core is a text editor.  It's one of the two main text editors
that programmers tend to evangelize.  Every time a new programming IDE is
released or a major feature is released you'll see comments along the lines of
"emacs has been doing that for 10 years."  It's hard to learn but _when_ you
actually learn it, the productivity boost is significant and continual.
Because of that, emacs power as a development environment is generally what
people focus on.  For me, the real power of emacs came to light when I started
to understand how much you can do with a text editor - and further, how much
easier it is to do it within one.

Emacs to me is a project planner, a task manager, a mail interface, an IRC
interface, a programming IDE and repl, an SCM interface, a note taking
application, a diagramming tool, a more powerful version of
jupyter-notebook, and a tool for making presentations.
