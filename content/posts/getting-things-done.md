David Allen developed the GTD速 or Getting Things Done速 Methodology and he has
quite a following.  There's a book, podcasts, training classes, etc.  Sadly, I
haven't researched any of it in depth.  But I have taken to the quick summary
of GTD速 and I think that's enough for anyone to get started:

1.  Capture

    Collect what has your attention.  Little or big - all your things that need
    to be handled.
2.  Clarify

    Take everything that you capture and ask:

    -   Is it actionable?
        -   Yes: decide on the very next action required.  If it will take less than 2
            minutes, to it now.  If not, delegate it (if possible), or put it on a
            list.
3.  Organize

     Put action reminders on the right lists.  For example create lists for the
    appropriate categories - calls to make, errands to run, emails to send,
    etc.
4.  Reflect

     Look over your lists as often as necessary to determine what to do next.
    Do a weekly review to clean up, update your lists, and clean your mind.
5.  Engage

    Use your system to take appropriate actions with confidence.

It takes a bit of practice to manage task lists in org-mode.  Many people go
through multiple attempts at trying to organize their own task lists.  Many
people go through a variety of software trying and failing.  Keeping this
simple process in mind as you build out and manage your tasks will increase
your chances of success.  Org-mode is very powerful.  Although the official
GTD速 seems to recommend tracking both personal and professional tasks together,
my mindset is to learn org-mode with your personal tasks, then apply it to your
professional life.  Learning is a process, and I don't recommend diving in
professionally without a good understanding of what org-mode is, what it can
do, and what it cannot.
