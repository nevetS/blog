## How to use my emacs configuration {#how-to-use-my-emacs-configuration}

There are a lot of good emacs configurations out there.  My configuration is
borrowed from many of them.  Once in a while, I'll become frustrated with one
aspect of emacs or another and I'll look into how people have addressed it.
That action tends to lead me down a rabbit hole of finding new features,
workflow, and configurations that interest me.  Then I build out a few changes
as I merge the possibilities with my own workflow needs.

This is all to say that my configuration is very personal.  The best way
forward with Emacs for anybody is to develop your own configuration based on
your own personal needs.  Of course, that's far from a possibility for someone
getting started and my personal experience is that it took years before I got
around to doing it for myself.

Depending on your level of experience, you will want to leverage my
configuration in a few different ways:

1.  Follow the installation instructions - I use this configuration across
    computers, operating systems, and sometimes different emacs versions.
    Because I use them myself I tend to keep installation instructions complete
    and up to date.
2.  Pick and choose the features you want - I try to keep the configuration of
    disparate features in separate files.  This should make it easy for you to
    copy my configuration into your own.
3.  Learn from what I'm doing, then make it better and more personalized for you.
